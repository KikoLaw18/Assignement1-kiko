Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them:
One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with typos in my code. Even a small typo could prevent the project from running, making debugging time-consuming. To overcome this, I started typing more carefully and double-checking my code before running it. Additionally, I used error messages and debugging tools in VS Code to quickly identify and fix mistakes.
